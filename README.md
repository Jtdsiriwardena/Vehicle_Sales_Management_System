## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions
1. The system assumes only admins can add, edit, or delete vehicles.
2. Each vehicle has at least brand and model to generate an AI-powered description.
3. Vehicle images uploaded are valid image files (PNG, JPG, GIF) and do not exceed 5MB per file.
4. The backend server runs on Node.js with MySQL as the database.
5. JWT tokens are required for accessing admin-only APIs.
6. AI-generated descriptions are suggestions and can be edited by the admin before saving.
7. Customers can only browse vehicles; they do not have accounts or login functionality yet.

### Limitations
1. The system does not support multiple user roles beyond admin at the moment.
2. AI description generation requires an OpenAI API key; if unavailable, descriptions must be manually entered.
3. No real-time notifications or chat features for customer inquiries yet.
